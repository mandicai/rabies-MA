          <h1>Is rabies still a thing in Massachusetts?</h1>
          <p>By Mandi Cai</p>
        </div>
        <p>I have an unhealthy habit of petting stray cats. They roam around my neighborhood in Cambridge, they're friendly, and I like to pet them
          on my way home from work every day. It's not the <i>best</i> idea, but I had no reason to stop receiving their affection.</p>

        <p> One day, I was petting a particularly erratic and jumpy teenage cat. It nipped me a bit while playing, and my friend at the time
          remarked: "Hey, you might want to be careful. Rabies is a thing."</p>

        <p>That statement got me thinking: <b>"Is rabies still a thing?"</b> 25 minutes of thorough hand-washing, 9 phone calls, and numerous WebMD and Reddit threads later,
          I was able to get a better picture of the current rabies landscape in Massachusetts (<b>spoiler:</b> cats are not common carriers of rabies, although there is
          always a chance that they'll come into contact with rabid animals).
        </p>

        <p>Luckily, <a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/rabies-surveillance-data">Mass.gov</a> publicizes several data sets, including its yearly reports on rabid animals throughout
          Massachusetts. Let's take a look:

    Website Instagram profile
    Miquela Sousa, better known as Lil Miquela, is a fictional character created by Trevor McFedries and Sara Decou as a
    digital art project.[1][2][3][4][5] Miquela is an Instagram model and music artist claiming to be from Downey,
    California.

    The project began in 2016 as an Instagram profile. By April 2018, the account had amassed more than a million followers
    by portraying the lifestyle of an Instagram it-girl over social media.[6] The account also details a fictional
    narrative which presents Miquela as a sentient robot in conflict with other digital projects created by McFedries and
    Decou.

    In August 2017, Miquela released her first single, "Not Mine".[7] Her pivot into music has been compared to virtual
    musicians Gorillaz and Hatsune Miku.
    Miquela’s first Instagram post was made on April 22, 2016. The project garnered both intrigue and criticism for the
    character's digital appearance with fans and online commenters oscillating between positing that Miquela is an art
    project or a social experiment carried out by a real unidentified woman. Miquela was rumored to be a marketing gimmick
    for The Sims.[citation needed] British model Emily Bador was rumored to be Miquela, fans citing the character's
    abundance of freckles. Bador openly acknowledged the physical similarity.[citation needed]

    Online presence
    Miquela has been pictured with a number of celebrities including Diplo, How to Dress Well, killerandasweetthang founder
    Eileen Kelly, Molly Soda, Nile Rogers, and Samantha Urbani.[8] She has been interviewed and or profiled in a number of
    publications including Refinery29, Vogue, Buzzfeed, v-files, Nylon, the Guardian, Business of Fashion, The Cut, and
    BBC.com.[citation needed] As well as by Shane Dawson, YouTube celebrity, in a phone interview.[9] She appeared on the
    cover of High Snobiety in April 2018.[10] In February 2018, Miquela did an Instagram takeover for Prada as part of
    Milan Fashion Week.[11]

    Online narratives
    In April 2018, a trans-media story began to play out on Miquela's Instagram involving @Blawko22, and @BermudaIsBae, two
    other virtual Instagram accounts who are presented as "sentient robots." The story suggests that two organizations are
    responsible for the creation of these sentient robots. In the narrative, fictional brand Brud created Miquela and
    "Blawko22" while competing fictional brand Cain Intelligence created "BermudaIsBae".

    On April 17, all of Miquela's Instagram posts were removed. "BermudaIsBae" was purported to have hacked Miquela's
    account. The two online personas then began posting pictures together as Miquela worked to reclaim the original
    account.[12] After reclaiming the account, Miquela posted a series of notes saying that she is a robot and claiming
    sentience.[13][14]

    Music career
    Miquela has released several singles since her debut with "Not Mine," including "You Should be Alone," "Over You," and
    a collaboration with Baauer titled "Hate Me." Her musical style is characterized by the use of auto-tune and
    trap-influenced production. Her music has been released on YouTube and Spotify. Miquela's sound is purportedly based
    off of the soundtrack to Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic, Evil Dead.
