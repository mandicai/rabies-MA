          <h1>Is rabies alive in Massachusetts?</h1>
          <p>By Mandi Cai</p>
        </div>
        <p>I have an unhealthy habit of petting stray cats. They roam around my neighborhood in Cambridge, they're friendly, and I like to pet them
          on my way home from work every day. It's not the <i>best</i> idea, but I had no reason to stop receiving their affection. Until recently.</p>

        <p>A couple months ago, I was petting a particularly erratic and jumpy teenage cat. It nipped me a bit while playing, and my friend at the time
          remarked: "Hey, you might want to be careful. Rabies is a thing."</p>

        <p>That statement got me thinking: <b>"Is rabies still a thing?"</b> A lot of people believe it to be an illness of the past - coming across a rabid animal is not a
          common experience anymore, nor is contracting the rabies virus itself. 25 minutes of thorough hand washing, 9 phone calls, numerous WebMD and Reddit threads, and 5 public datasets later,
          I was able to get a better picture of the current rabies landscape in Massachusetts (<b>spoiler:</b> cats are not common carriers of rabies, although there is
          always a chance that they'll come into contact with rabid animals). Phew!
        </p>

        <p>My peace of mind came primarily from <a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/rabies-surveillance-data">Mass.gov</a>, which offers several public data sets including the yearly reports on rabid animals throughout
          Massachusetts. Let's take a look:

                Across all 5 years, raccoons make up the highest percentage of rabid animals accounted for in MA.

                Bats, which are common carriers of rabies and often leave undetected bites, accounted for a smaller
                percentage than raccoons and skunks.

              <p>It's pretty clear that raccoons, skunks, and bats have shared a large portion
                of the rabid animal pool in MA.

              <p>Each year, around <b>400-500</b> dogs are submitted for rabies testing, but none have been found rabid.
                Dog owners must comply with the mandatory rabies shots required by MA law for cats and dogs.

              <p>However, any dog involved in a biting incident must be quarantined for 10 days. An animal control officer
              will determine during this period of observation whether the dog needs rabies treatment.

                Around <b>600-700</b> cats are submitted for rabies testing each year. Cats are often left outside to roam,
                and are thus exposed more frequently to common carriers of rabies such as raccoons, skunks, and bats.

              <p>Bats are by the far the most submitted animal for rabies testing. Around <b>900-1000</b> bats
                are submitted each year.

              <p>Bats are known as (and sensationalized as) rabies carriers, which would
                attribute to the high number of submitted bats. It is also better to err
                on the side of caution with bats because their bites can go undetected.

        <p>Mass.gov also provides the numbers of animals reported and positive for rabies by county. Different species may occupy various habitats of differing square footage and have diverse migratory patterns.</p>

        <p>For example, foxes can "actively maintain territories that may vary in size from 2 to 7 square miles," according to <a href="https://www.mass.gov/service-details/learn-about-foxes">Mass.gov</a>. They enjoy spending time in the intersections of
        forests, fields, and thickets. Bats will occupy buildings and trees in the summer and move to caves or migrate elsewhere in the winter. The <a href="https://www.mass.gov/service-details/bats-of-massachusetts">9
        different species of bats</a> native to Massachusetts can be found all over the state.</p>

        <p>Let's take a look at the different counties in Massachusetts and the rabid animals reported in each from 2013-2017.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Worcester County had <b>366</b> animals submitted for rabies testing and <b>22</b> animals were found
