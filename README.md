# rabies-MA

I was nipped by a cat & got curious about the state of rabies in Massachusetts (for my own wellbeing). Data is from the [Mass.gov website](https://www.mass.gov/lists/rabies-surveillance-data).

Visualizations made in D3, scrolly sctory created with the help of [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama) & [this article](https://pudding.cool/process/scrollytelling-sticky/) about using `position:sticky`.

To run, `git clone` the repo, `cd` into the project, and run `http-server -c-1 -p 8000` (or any local server of your choice) to view the project at `localhost:8000`.
