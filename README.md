# rabies-MA

I was nipped by a cat & got curious about the state of rabies in Massachusetts (for my own wellbeing). Data is from the [Mass.gov website](https://www.mass.gov/lists/rabies-surveillance-data). Visualizations made in D3, scrolliness created with the help of [Scrollama](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama) & [this article](https://pudding.cool/process/scrollytelling-sticky/) about using `position:sticky`.
